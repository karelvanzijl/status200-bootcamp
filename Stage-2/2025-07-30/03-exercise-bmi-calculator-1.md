# Exercise: BMI Calculator 1.0

## Overview

Your task is to create a **Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator** using HTML and JavaScript. This assignment will test your understanding of:

-   HTML input fields and forms
-   JavaScript functions
-   Getting values from input fields
-   Performing calculations
-   Displaying results to users

## What is BMI?

**Body Mass Index (BMI)** is a measure used to determine if a person has a healthy weight for their height.

**Formula:** `BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2`

**Example:** If someone weighs 70 kg and is 1.75 m tall:

-   BMI = 70 / (1.75 \* 1.75) = 70 / 3.0625 = 22.86

**$Note$:** _Don't worry about the amount of decimal places for the BMI value. We'll keep it simple for now and just show the results of the calculation without rounding._

## Assignment Requirements

### Part 1: Basic BMI Calculator

Create a web page that:

1. **Has a title** - "BMI Calculator"
2. **Has two input fields:**
    - Weight (in kilograms)
    - Height (in meters)
3. **Has a button** - "Calculate BMI"
4. **Displays the result** - Shows the calculated BMI value

### Part 2: Personalized Results

If you finish Part 1 early, make the calculator more personal:

1. **Add a name input field** - "Enter your name"
2. **Use the name in your result** - Instead of showing "Your BMI is 22.86", show "Hello John, your BMI is 22.86"

**Example:** If someone enters "Sarah" as their name, the result should display: "Hello Sarah, your BMI is 22.86"

## Testing Your Calculator

Test your calculator with these values:

### Task 1

-   **Weight: 70 kg, Height: 1.75 m** → Your BMI is 22.86
-   **Weight: 80 kg, Height: 1.80 m** → Your BMI is 24.69
-   **Weight: 60 kg, Height: 1.65 m** → Your BMI is 22.04

### Task 2

-   **Name:** Alex,
-   **Weight:** 70 kg,
-   **Height:** 1.75 m

Should show _"Hello Alex, your BMI is 22.86"_
