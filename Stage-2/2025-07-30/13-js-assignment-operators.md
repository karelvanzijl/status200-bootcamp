# Assignment Operators in JavaScript

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

### Simple Assignment (`=`)

```javascript
let x = 10; // x is assigned the value 10
```

### Addition Assignment (`+=`)

```javascript
let y = 5;
y += 3; // y is now 8 (5 + 3)
```

### Subtraction Assignment (`-=`)

```javascript
let z = 10;
z -= 4; // z is now 6 (10 - 4)
```

### Multiplication Assignment (`*=`)

```javascript
let a = 2;
a *= 3; // a is now 6 (2 * 3)
```

### Division Assignment (`/=`)

```javascript
let b = 20;
b /= 5; // b is now 4 (20 / 5)
```

### Modulus Assignment (`%=`)

```javascript
let c = 10;
c %= 3; // c is now 1 (10 % 3)
```

### Exponentiation Assignment (`**=`)

```javascript
let d = 2;
d **= 3; // d is now 8 (2 raised to the power of 3)
```
