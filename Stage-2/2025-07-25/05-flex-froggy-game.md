## Flex container properties

Work through levels 1-12. These focus on flex container properties - exactly what we just practiced!"

### Step 1: Game Session - Levels 1-4

**Finished:** Great! You've mastered basic justify-content

_**Questions** to consider after finishing:_

-   What does `justify-content: center` do?
-   When would you use `space-between` vs `space-around`?
-   Which property moves items along the main axis?

### Step 2: Game Session - Levels 5-7

**Finished:** Fantastic! You understand how to align items

_**Questions** to consider after finishing:_

-   "How is `align-items` different from `justify-content`?"
-   "What happens when you use `align-items: center`?"
-   "Which axis does align-items control?"

### Step 3: Game Session - Levels 8-13

**Finished:** Awesome! Flex-direction is clicking

_**Questions** to consider after finishing:_

-   "What happens to justify-content when flex-direction is column?"
-   "Why does the frog behavior change?"
-   "What's the difference between main axis and cross axis?"

---

**Remember:** `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-direction` are applied to the **flex container** (the parent element), not the frogs (the flex items).

## Common Struggles & Solutions

### "My Code Isn't Working"

**Check:**

-   Spelling: `justify-content` not `justify content`
-   Colons and semicolons: `justify-content: center;`
-   Valid values: `center` not `middle`

### "I Don't Understand the Difference"

**Check:**

-   `justify-content` = main axis (horizontal by default)
-   `align-items` = cross axis (vertical by default)
-   `flex-direction` changes which axis is which

### "The Frog Went the Wrong Way"

**Debug:**

-   Check if you're using the right property
-   Remember: direction matters after `flex-direction: column`

## Extension for Fast Finishers

**If you finish early:**

1. **Help a classmate** - Explain your solution process
2. **Continue to level 24** - Explore _flex item properties_
3. **Try CSS Grid Garden** - Another great game at [cssgridgarden.com](https://cssgridgarden.com) that teaches CSS Grid concepts
4. **Challenge yourself** - Can you solve levels using different property combinations?
