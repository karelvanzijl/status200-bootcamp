## Part 4: Working with Numbers

### Exercise 10: Grade Average
Calculate the average of test scores and display each score along with how it compares to the average.

let scores = [85, 92, 78, 88, 95];
// Calculate average first, then compare each score
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Average score: 87.6
Score 1: 85 (Below average)
Score 2: 92 (Above average)
Score 3: 78 (Below average)
Score 4: 88 (Above average)
Score 5: 95 (Above average)
```

### Exercise 11: Shopping Cart Subtotals
Display each item price and show a running subtotal.

```javascript
let items = [5.99, 12.50, 8.75, 15.00];
// Your code here
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Item 1: $5.99 (Subtotal: $5.99)
Item 2: $12.50 (Subtotal: $18.49)
Item 3: $8.75 (Subtotal: $27.24)
Item 4: $15.00 (Subtotal: $42.24)
Final Total: $42.24
```

## Part 5: Simple Nested Loops

### Exercise 12: Color and Size Combinations
Create all possible combinations of colors and sizes.

```javascript
let colors = ['red', 'blue'];
let sizes = ['small', 'large'];
// Your code here
```

**Expected Output:**
```
red small
red large
blue small
blue large
```

### Exercise 13: Number Multiplication Table
Create a simple multiplication table using two small arrays.

```javascript
let numbers1 = [2, 3];
let numbers2 = [4, 5];
// Your code here
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 Ã— 4 = 8
2 Ã— 5 = 10
3 Ã— 4 = 12
3 Ã— 5 = 15
```

## Part 6: Array Methods Introduction

Before moving to more complex exercises, let's learn about some useful array methods:

### `push()` - Add to End of Array

The `push()` method adds one or more elements to the end of an array.

```javascript
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana'];
fruits.push('orange');
console.log(fruits); // ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']

// You can add multiple items at once
fruits.push('grape', 'kiwi');
console.log(fruits); // ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape', 'kiwi']
```

### `pop()` - Remove from End of Array

The `pop()` method removes the last element from an array and returns it.

```javascript
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
let lastFruit = fruits.pop(); // Removes 'orange'
console.log(lastFruit); // 'orange'
console.log(fruits); // ['apple', 'banana']
```

### `indexOf()` - Find Position of Item

The `indexOf()` method returns the first index where an element is found, or -1 if not found.

```javascript
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
let position = fruits.indexOf('banana'); // Returns 1
console.log(position); // 1

let notFound = fruits.indexOf('grape'); // Returns -1
console.log(notFound); // -1
```

## Part 7: Challenge Exercises (Combining Everything)

These exercises require you to combine loops with array methods and logical thinking. If you find them difficult, review the basics first.

### Exercise 14: Dynamic Array Building
Start with an empty array. Use a loop to add numbers 1 through 5 to the array, then display the final array.

```javascript
let numbers = [];
// Use a loop and push() to add numbers 1-5
// Then display the array
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Final array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Exercise 15: Remove Last Item Repeatedly
Start with an array of colors. Use a loop to remove one item at a time until the array is empty, showing what was removed each time.

```javascript
let colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow'];
// Use a loop and pop() to remove items one by one
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Removed: yellow, Remaining: [red, green, blue]
Removed: blue, Remaining: [red, green]
Removed: green, Remaining: [red]
Removed: red, Remaining: []
Array is now empty!
```

### Exercise 16: Search and Report
Create an array of student names. Ask (simulate asking) for a specific name and report whether that student exists and at what position.

```javascript
let students = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Diana', 'Eve'];
let searchName = 'Charlie'; // Simulate user input
// Use indexOf() to find the student
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Student 'Charlie' found at position 3 (index 2)
```

### Exercise 17: Grade Counter with Conditions
Count how many students passed (score >= 70) and failed (score < 70).

```javascript
let scores = [85, 65, 92, 45, 78, 88, 55, 91];
// Use a loop to count passed and failed students
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Checking 8 scores...
Passed: 5 students
Failed: 3 students
Pass rate: 62.5%
```

### Exercise 18: Shopping Cart Manager
Start with a cart array and simulate adding items based on a list, but only add items that aren't already in the cart.

```javascript
let cart = ['apple', 'bread'];
let itemsToAdd = ['milk', 'apple', 'cheese', 'bread', 'eggs'];
// Use indexOf() to check if item exists before adding
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Adding milk to cart
apple is already in cart
Adding cheese to cart
bread is already in cart
Adding eggs to cart
Final cart: [apple, bread, milk, cheese, eggs]
```

### Exercise 19: Nested Loop with Conditions
Create a seating chart where some seats are taken. Display all available seats.

```javascript
let rows = ['A', 'B'];
let seats = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let taken = ['A2', 'B1', 'B4']; // Format: RowSeat
// Use nested loops and indexOf() to check if seat is taken
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Available seats:
A1
A3
A4
B2
B3
```

### Exercise 20: Advanced Pattern Challenge
Create a pattern where for each number 1-3, you display that number of stars.

**Expected Output:**
```
1: *
2: **
3: ***
```

## Homework Solutions

Try to solve all exercises before looking at the solutions. If you get stuck, review the concepts from the main lesson file.

**Remember:**
- Start with the easier exercises and work your way up
- If you can't solve the challenge exercises, make sure you understand all the basic ones first
- Practice with different arrays and numbers to really master these concepts
- The challenge exercises test whether you truly understand the fundamentals

**Good luck!** ðŸš€
