# JavaScript Exercise - Simple Counter

**Difficult part:**

-   What variable declaration should you use for your counter?
-   Where should you place the variable declaration?

### Exercise 1

Create a counter that starts at 0. The user can click a button to increase the counter by 1. The current count is displayed in a paragraph below the button.

### Exercise 2

Add two new buttons: "Add 5" and "Subtract 5" that change the counter by 5 instead of 1.

### Exercise 3

Add a "Double" button that multiplies the current count by 2. Also add a "Half" button that divides the current count by 2.

**Hint:** Use `*` for multiplication and `/` for division. For the half button, you might get decimal numbers!
