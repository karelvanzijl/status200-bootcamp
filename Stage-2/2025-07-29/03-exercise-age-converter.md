# JavaScript Exercise - Age Converter

### Exercise 1

Create a age converter.

The user can enter their age in years, and the converter will calculate and display their age in days. The age in days is displayed in a paragraph below the input field.

**Hint:** Use the formula `age × 365` to convert years to days.

### Exercise 2

Modify the converter to also show the calculation formula. For example: "25 × 365 = 9125 days" instead of just showing the result.

### Exercise 3

Add a second conversion that also calculates hours and minutes. Add two more result paragraphs that show:

-   Hours: age × 365 × 24
-   Minutes: age × 365 × 24 × 60

### Exercise 4

Do you think you could rewrite the converter so that the user inputs their birth year instead of their age in days?
