# Assigment: ATM Machine 1.0

## Setup

Use the files we already created in the previous assignment. If you don't have them, follow these steps described in [this assignment](./24-assigment-atm-machine-1.md).

## Task

Rewrite the ATM machine functionality which is now using `if ... else` statements. Instead of using `if ... else`, use the `switch` statement.

## Question

Which one do you prefer, `if ... else` or `switch`?

## Remark

Like we mentioned earlier, both `if ... else` and `switch` statements can be used to control the flow of your program based on conditions. It depends on your preference which one you use. There's no right or wrong approach.
