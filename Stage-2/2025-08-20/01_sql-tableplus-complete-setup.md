# SQL Fundamentals 

## Every App Uses Databases - Here's Why You Need to Learn SQL

Have you ever wondered how your favorite apps remember everything about you? When you open Instagram, how does it show YOUR photos? When you shop on shoppee, how does it remember what's in YOUR cart? When you log into Netflix, how does it know YOUR viewing history?

**The answer: Databases.**

Every website, every app, every digital service you use stores information in databases. And to work with that information, developers use SQL.

## What is a Database?

A **database** is an organized collection of data stored electronically. Think of it as a super-powered digital filing cabinet with multiple drawers (called tables), where each drawer contains folders (called records) with specific information about users, products, posts, etc.

### Real-World Database Examples

Every website and app you use relies on databases:

#### **Netflix**
- **Users table**: Your account info, preferences, viewing history
- **Movies table**: Title, genre, release date, rating
- **Reviews table**: User ratings and comments
- **Viewing_history table**: What you watched and when

#### **Banking App**
- **Accounts table**: Account numbers, balances, account types
- **Transactions table**: Deposits, withdrawals, transfers
- **Users table**: Customer information and login credentials

**Without databases, these websites would lose all your data every time you refresh the page!**

## What is SQL?

Now that you understand databases store all this information, here's the key question: **How do we actually GET that information out of the database?**

**SQL** (Structured Query Language) is a programming language designed specifically for managing and manipulating data stored in databases. Think of it as a way to "talk" to databases - you can ask questions, add information, update records, and organize data.

SQL is like asking questions in a very specific way:
- "Show me all students who are older than 18"
- "Add a new student named John with email john@example.com"
- "Update Sarah's age to 21"
- "Delete all students who graduated"

## Why Do We Need SQL?

1. **Data Storage**: Store millions of records efficiently
2. **Data Retrieval**: Find specific information quickly
3. **Data Relationships**: Connect related information (users and their posts)
4. **Data Security**: Control who can access what information
5. **Data Integrity**: Ensure data is accurate and consistent
