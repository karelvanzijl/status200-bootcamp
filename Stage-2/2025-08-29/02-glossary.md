# Quick-Reference Glossary

This document is a curated quick-reference glossary that provides direct links to the major programming topics covered in Stage 2 of the bootcamp course.

It serves as a convenient navigation aid for students working on their final assignment, helping them quickly access key concepts like Node servers, databases, APIs, JavaScript fundamentals, and DOM manipulation without searching through the full documentation.
