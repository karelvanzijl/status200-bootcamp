# Getting Started

## React

React is a JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive userinterfaces.

It was create at Facebook in 2011.

It is currently the most widely used JavaScript librabry for front end development.

In Stage 3 we're going to learn you how to confidently build applications with React

### Why was React created?

When a web page is loaded in a browser, the browser takes the HTML code and creates a tree like structure called the `document object model` or the `DOM`.

This allows us to use JavaScript and change the page content in response to user actions. For example we can use JavaScript to hide an element when a button is clicked. This is called `Vanilla JavaScript`, meaning plain JavaScript code without third party tools.

As our application grows working with the DOM can become complex and challenging to manage. This is where React comes into play. With React, we no longer need to worry about querying and updating DOM elements.

Instead we describe a webpage using small reusable `components`. And React will take care of efficiently creating and updating DOM elements.

**Components**

`components` help us write reusable, modular and better oragized code.
