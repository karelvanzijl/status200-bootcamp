    <!-- 
      The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.
      The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.
      An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it 
      always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.

      Note: A "positioned" element is one whose position is anything except static.

      Note: `z-index` only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky).

      Note: If two positioned elements overlap without a z-index specified, the element positioned last in the HTML code will be shown on top.
