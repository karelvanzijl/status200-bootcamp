      Remember: Axes

      - The main axis is the primary axis along which the flex items are placed.
      - The cross axis is the secondary axis along which the flex items are placed.
      - If the flex-direction property is set to row, the main axis is horizontal and the cross axis is vertical.
      - If the flex-direction property is set to column, the main axis is vertical and the cross axis is horizontal.

      Aligning Items:

      - justify-content: aligns flex items along the main axis.
      - align-items: aligns flex items along the cross axis.
      - align-content: aligns flex lines along the cross axis.
      - flex-wrap: specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not.
