# HTML Basics

Now that you know how to use folders and the terminal, it‚Äôs time to write your first real code: a personal web page using **HTML**.

---

## What is HTML?

**HTML** stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is the basic building block of the web. HTML tells the browser what content to display (text, images, links, etc.) and how it is structured.

A simple HTML page looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My First Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <p>This is my first website.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

---

### üí° Quick tip in VS Code:

In a new `.html` file, just type `!` and press `Tab` ‚Äî this will automatically generate the full HTML boilerplate for you as shown below. It's a built-in shortcut and saves time.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body></body>
</html>
```

## Important HTML Tags

| Tag      | What it does                              |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `<html>` | The root element of the page              |
| `<head>` | Info _about_ the page (not shown on page) |
| `<body>` | The visible content of the page           |
| `<h1>`   | A big title                               |
| `<p>`    | A paragraph of text                       |
| `<a>`    | A hyperlink                               |
| `<img>`  | An image                                  |

### üí° Want More Tags?

There are many more HTML tags you can use to build webpages ‚Äî like lists, tables, forms, and more. We'll cover some of these later in the course.

## Activity: Make Your Own Homepage

### Step 1: Use the Terminal to Create Folders & File

1. Open your terminal
2. Go to your `Documents` folder:

    - Windows:

    ```bash
    cd %USERPROFILE%\Documents
    ```

    - Mac/Linux:

    ```bash
    cd ~/Documents
    ```

3. Create a folder for your projects and go into it:

    ```bash
    mkdir Projects
    cd Projects
    ```

4. Create a subfolder for today's work:

    ```bash
    mkdir day1
    cd day1
    ```

5. Create a file called `index.html`:

    - Mac/Linux:

        ```bash
        touch index.html
        ```

    - Windows:

        ```bash
        echo > index.html
        ```

6. Open the folder in VS Code:

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

### Step 2: Write Your HTML Code

In `index.html`, write your own homepage using this template:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>My Personal Homepage</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>[Your Name]</h1>

        <p>
            Hello! My name is [Your Name]. I just started learning to code and
            this is my first webpage!
        </p>

        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/250" width="250" />

        <p>Here‚Äôs a link to something I like:</p>

        <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">
            Visit my favorite website
        </a>
    </body>
</html>
```

-   Replace `[Your Name]` with your actual name.
-   You can also use a **local image** (put it in the same folder and change the `src`).
-   Replace `https://www.example.com` with the URL of your favorite website

### üí° Bonus: View Your Website

There are two ways to open your website in the browser:

---

#### Option 1: Use Live Server (Recommended)

If you installed the **Live Server** extension in VS Code, you can launch your page with just one click.

1. Open your `index.html` file in VS Code
2. Right-click anywhere in the code editor
3. Click **"Open with Live Server"**

Your browser will open the page automatically. Every time you save the file, the page will refresh to show your changes!

> üí° If nothing happens, check if your browser blocked pop-ups or if Live Server is installed correctly.

---

#### Option 2: Open the File Manually

1. Go to your `day1` folder using **File Explorer** (Windows) or **Finder** (Mac)
2. Double-click the `index.html` file  
   OR right-click ‚Üí "Open With" ‚Üí choose your browser

You can also drag and drop the file directly into a browser window.

> You‚Äôll see a URL starting with `file:///...` ‚Äî this means the browser is opening a file from your computer, not the internet.
