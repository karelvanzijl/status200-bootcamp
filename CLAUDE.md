## Teaching Methodology

The curriculum follows a progressive learning approach:
1. **Concept Introduction**: Clear explanations with visual aids
2. **Guided Practice**: Step-by-step exercises with instructor support
3. **Independent Application**: Solo exercises building confidence
4. **Project Integration**: Real-world applications combining multiple concepts
5. **Assessment**: Quizzes and assignments testing understanding
6. **Review & Reinforcement**: Debugging exercises and troubleshooting practice

This structure ensures students build solid foundations while gaining practical experience through hands-on projects and interactive exercises.

## Development Commands

*Note: No specific build/test commands were found in the curriculum files. This appears to be an educational repository focused on teaching concepts rather than a production codebase.*

## Next Steps for Stage 2

Based on the file structure, Stage 2 continues beyond August 8, 2025, with additional content that may cover:
- Advanced JavaScript concepts
- More complex projects and applications
- Additional programming fundamentals
- Potential introduction to frameworks or libraries

The curriculum demonstrates a well-structured, progressive approach to web development education with strong emphasis on practical application and project-based learning.
